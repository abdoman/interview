The interview questions will be divided into 4 categories (Javascript, Python, PHP, SQL and Data).

For the data oriented questions, please create a new source file in that directory.

Important: Download or clone the repository locally, complete as many questions as you are able, compress the directories containing your answers, and email your submission to ravi at laplacian.co and tam at laplacian.co

Please do not fork, post a pull request, or in any other way publicly expose your answers.

Any vagueness in the questions or difficulty that you encounter reproducing the source locally and getting it to run is a useful and intentional part of the evaluation, as such, while feedback is always appreciated, candidates experiencing difficulty should attempt to work through the challenge using the resources they would use to navigate any other individual challenge rather than sending us a request for assistance.
