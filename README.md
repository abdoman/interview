The interview questions will be divided into 4 categories (Javascript, Python, PHP, SQL and Data).

For the data oriented questions, please create a new source file in that directory.

Important: Download or clone the repository locally, complete as many questions as you are able, compress the directories containing your answers, and email your submission to ravi at laplacian.co and tam at laplacian.co

Please do not fork, post a pull request, or in any other way publicly expose your answers.

Any questions or problems that you've encounter reproducing the source locally or getting it to run is a useful and intentional part of the evaluation. Candidates are recommended to try to resolve the issues, rather than asking for assistance.
